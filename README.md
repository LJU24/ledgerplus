# ledgerplus
A "friendly fork" of the SQL Ledger software from sql-ledger.com

The main aims are
    * To support l10n efforts in the SQL Ledger community hoping that these efforts will be integrated into other projects as well as upstream
    * Adding further server-sided business analytics functions using server sided procedures to be implemented soon.
    * Please not that the analytics will mostly be done on Postgres: If you SQL Ledger installation relies on DB2 or Oracle this repository will have little use for you.
    * Adding the business analytics server-sided functions as an optional add-on during installation.
