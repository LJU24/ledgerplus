# ledgerplus
A "friendly fork" of the SQL Ledger software from sql-ledger.com

The main aims are
- To support l10n efforts in the SQL Ledger community hoping that these efforts will be integrated into other projects as well as upstream
- Adding further server-sided business analytics functions using server sided procedures to be implemented soon.
- Please not that the analytics will mostly be done on Postgres: If you SQL Ledger installation relies on DB2 or Oracle this repository will have little use for you.
- Adding the business analytics server-sided functions as an optional add-on during installation.

- Possible custom reports and enhancements (to be implemented later)
- Which tasks have been fulfilled with the customer during a given period? Workaround currently is to set up a project and add time stamps there. 
- Adding photos and documents with the customer file (use case: such as a portrait, logo or contractual documents)
- Which tasks still need to be done and when is the deadline. kivitendo has implemented such a feature. Reminder of a few days/one week in advance.
anstehende Arbeiten (wann ist was noch zu erledigen) mit Erinnerung ca. 1Woche vorher..
- Statistics
- How much did you earn with a specific customer and how many work hours did it take?
- How much has been earned with a specific service/work/product in which sector (workaround is to use "Type of Business" but as far as I know these kinds of reports do not yet exist.
- Which work or type of business is most profitable? (To form a basis for reasonable investment decisions)
